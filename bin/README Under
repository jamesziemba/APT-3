Started this APT on January 29 and finished it January 31. It took about 3 hours.
I consulted StackOverflow.
I did not consult anyone.
This was a pretty difficult APT. The toughest part was figuring out how to not count each character twice when comparing the maps of the letters
in notes and clips.
