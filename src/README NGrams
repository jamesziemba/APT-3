Started and finished this APT on Feb. 2. It took me about 2 hours.
I consulted with fellow 201er Nick Pagliuca. We talked about different ways to record the indexes of the letters. Conversation only. NO CODE WAS SHARED
I consulted StackOverflow.
This was tough because the user had to figure out how to compare indexes of words with completely different letters. I was initially going to use a
map, but figured out that doing so would cause too much complication. Converting the letters into indexes made comparison much easier.
