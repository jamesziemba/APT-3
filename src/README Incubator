Started and completed this APT on Jan. 30. It took about 30 min.
I consulted StackOverflow for some unknown Java methods.
I did not consult anyone.
This was pretty tricky given that names could be in an array more than once. Once I realized that I should just convert each array into a HashSet,
this APT was done easily.
